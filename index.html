    <h1>Algebra 1 Standards</h1>
    <!--This is only meant to be a sample-->
    <p>The purpose of this page is provide an interactive resource for students and teachers to gauge mastery of the essential <em><a href=https://www.engageny.org/resource/high-school-algebra-i>Common Core Standards</a></em> for High School Algebra 1.
       For each standard, all state assessment questions will be provided as well as links to resources for how to solve that particular problem.</p>

    <p>While procedural knowledge is, of course, important, it is essential to have a <strong>concrete, conceptual</strong> understanding of the mathematics behind the problem.  To help with 
    this, we will also provde interactive activities that are designed to build that knowledge</p>
    <h2>List of State Standards</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>N-Q.1 Use units as a way to understand problems and to guide the solution of multi-step problems; choose and interpret units consistently in formulas; choose and interpret the scale and the origin in graphs and data displays</li>
          <ol type="i">
              <li>Skill #1 <a href="skillone.html">click me</a></li>
              <li>Skill #2</li>
          </ol>
        <li>N-Q.2 Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of desciptive modeling</li>
        <li>N-Q.3 Choose a level of accuracy appropriate to limitations on measurement when reporting quantities</li>
    </ul>
