    <h1>Algebra 1 Standards</h1>
    <!--This is only meant to be a sample-->
    <p>The purpose of this page is provide a resource for students to gauge their mastery of the essential <em><a href=https://www.engageny.org/resource/high-school-algebra-i>Common Core Standards</a></em> for High School Algebra 1.
       For each standard, all state assessment questions will be provided as well as links to resources for how to solve that particular problem.</p>

    <p>The table below shows the approximate percentage of questions on each exam, separated by domain and standard.  Those marked "major" are the core skills that students must master and <em>comprise between 56% and 73% of the available points on the exam.</em></p>
